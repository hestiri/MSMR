# MSMR: the minimize sparsity and maximize relevance (MSMR) package,
To minimize sparsity, MSMR removes any feature that has a prevalence smaller than X%. For maximizing relevance, MSMR is principally a supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm that takes a silver-standard class label Y to compute information gain metrics for all features. MSMR is able to effectively scale to large dimensionality spaces, and thus is a high-throughput algorithm.
